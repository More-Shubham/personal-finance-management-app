# Personal Finance Management App
Economic uncertainty and changing financial priorities have led to increased interest in personal finance management. This app helps users track expenses, set budgets, manage investments, and visualize financial goals, empowering them to make informed financial decisions and improve their financial well-being.

### Technologies
- Mobile Development:
  - Develop native apps for iOS _(Swift)_ and Android _(Kotlin)_ for an optimal user experience.

- Database:
  - Implement a secure database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store user financial data _(transactions, budgets, goals)_.
- Financial Data Aggregation _(Optional)_:
  - Integrate with financial data aggregation services _(APIs)_ to allow secure import of transaction data from banks and credit cards. This requires user consent and strong security measures.
